# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start the program
### Step 2: 
Get the input values as l1,l2
### Step 3:

import math
x1,y1=4,2
x2,y2=10,6
dis=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(f"{dis:.2f}")
```
### OUTPUT:
